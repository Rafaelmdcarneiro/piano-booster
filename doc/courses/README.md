## 05-ScarboroughFair

![score](BoosterMusic/05-ScarboroughFair.svg)

**Scarborough Fair** spans a range of eight notes and so you will have to move fingers up the piano. Use the fingering that you feel comfortable with but ensure that you **use all your fingers** (of your right hand).

**Hint:** _Don't think about what fingers to use, just use the fingering that **comes naturally to you**._

## 06-Greensleeves

Normally the sharp symbol is not shown when **F#** is played (but turning on **Courtesy Accidentals** from the Piano Booster setup/preferences menu will show all accidentals in the key signature). The melody is in the right hand with a simple left hand part.

**Hint:** _You can show **Courtesy Accidentals** from the PianoBooster setup/preferences menu. But remember to **turn them off** when you get more skilled._
